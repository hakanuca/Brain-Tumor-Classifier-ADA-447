# Brain-Tumor-Classifier-ADA-447
This model is designed to automatically detect brain tumors from MRI images. It learns to recognize the presence of a tumor by analyzing many labeled MRI scans (tumor or no tumor).

After training, the model can predict whether a tumor is present or not in a new MRI image. This helps doctors with preliminary diagnoses and allows for faster and more accurate analysis.
